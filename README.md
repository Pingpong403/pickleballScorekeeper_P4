# Pickleball Scorekeeper
### made in Processing

Initially a project done in Python using the terminal, I wanted to bring this idea to the GUI scene. Processing can be a very elegant prospect for a GUI.

Ever wanted an easy way to keep score in pickleball? Well, here it is! Anyone watching the game can run this program, press a few buttons, and have an accurate, real-time
scoreboard for their friends.

To set up the game, choose which side is starting using "Swap," set what score they're going to with the "+" and "-" keys, and toggle between winning by one point and winning by two.

Once it's all set up, simply click whatever button corresponds to the side that just scored. If it's their serve, they'll get a point. If not, then they'll either advance to the second
serve or pass on the serve to the other team.

You can also make sure the players understand the score by making sure what they announce matches what you see at the bottom of the screen.
